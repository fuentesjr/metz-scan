# Project Tracker

This is the short, curated project-state file. Keep recent implementation notes
in `implementation-notes.md`, archived chronological notes under
`docs/archive/`, and local scratch strategy under `logs/`.

This file is the primary local coordination surface instead of GitHub Projects
or individual issues because recent work has been a fast-moving sequence of
agent-driven calibration and release-hardening slices. A tracked repo file gives
every future agent immediate offline context, updates atomically with the code
commit that changed direction, and preserves the "why now / not next" boundary
next to the source. Use GitHub issues and projects for external/public
coordination, releases, and user-facing work; use this tracker to orient local
agents before deciding whether GitHub work should be opened or updated.

Update this file at the end of each committed slice when the current direction,
next queue, parked work, or recent-completion table changes.

Standing rules:

- Do not start a new slice while `origin/main` CI is red; triage and fix the
  failure first so red runs cannot accumulate behind local work.
- Run `bin/check_ci_parity` before pushing. It reruns the single-command CI
  steps against the committed HEAD in a clean clone, so local-only environment
  assumptions (bundler config such as the optional rubydex group, untracked
  files) fail locally instead of in CI.

## Current Direction

`metz-scan` is currently optimizing for conservative release readiness,
calibration confidence, and evidence-led tooling decisions, not detector
expansion.

The project analyzer detector set has enough current evidence to stay
candidate-heavy and opt-in. Recent work has therefore moved to release smoke,
artifact-pipeline reliability, package/release metadata hardening, and bounded
tooling spikes that do not commit the project to new maintenance surfaces.

## Current Snapshot

- Date: 2026-07-03.
- Latest pushed baseline: `543dfe2 Record issue queue sync`.
- CI state: run `28689484542` for `543dfe2` succeeded. Earlier runs for
  `c0a01f5` (`28672899400`) and `64bceea` (`28680427556`) failed on
  calibration evidence runner environment assumptions, both since fixed.
- Release checklist issue: [#30](https://github.com/fuentesjr/metz-scan/issues/30),
  `Release v0.4.0`, is closed with the checklist complete.
- Release state: `v0.4.0` is tagged at `937afd8`, the GitHub Release is
  published, both GitHub Packages gems are published, and
  `bin/check_published_gem 0.4.0` passed.
- Local branch state: release tag, release target, release completion,
  package-monitor checkpoint, feedback-sweep checkpoint, Sorbet spike report,
  and issue-sync tracker checkpoint are pushed to `origin/main`; this handoff
  checkpoint is local until pushed.
- Latest checkpoint window: 17:35:05-17:42:44 -0700, 7m 39s elapsed.
- Working tree expectation: keep tracked work clean before starting another
  slice; keep ignored `logs/` notes out of commits unless explicitly requested.

## Active Workstreams

| Workstream | Status | Current State | Next Move |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Release readiness | Complete | `v0.4.0` is tagged, released on GitHub, published to GitHub Packages for both gems, verified with repeated post-publish smoke, issue #30 is closed, and post-release CI for `543dfe2` is green. | Monitor package installation feedback; no `0.4.x` follow-up milestone is open without a concrete defect. |
| Calibration artifact pipeline | Healthy | Markdown output, artifact write path, sample-app calibration smoke, and the tracked target manifest under `docs/calibration/` are covered. | Maintain; change only when artifact or target-manifest behavior changes. |
| Analyzer behavior | Parked | Generic classifier checkpoint concluded current evidence is too mixed for behavior changes; #27 and #28 now have explicit evidence bars for any future implementation slice. | Reopen only with new generic evidence, not app-specific suppressions. |
| Calibration evidence | Watching | Redmine, Rubygems.org, ManageIQ, and Foreman evidence has been consolidated. | Do not add another target by default. |
| Sorbet adoption spike | Complete | Issue #26 was evaluated in a disposable workspace, documented, synced back to GitHub, and closed. The report recommends not adopting now: a narrow static setup is possible, but generated RBI churn, command policy, fixture scope, and runtime signature implications outweigh observed value. | Do not add Sorbet unless a concrete type-related defect, contributor ergonomics need, or stable public API typing requirement appears. |
| Docs/adoption | Stable | README points contributors and agents to this tracker; old implementation notes are archived, current notes are short, and the Sorbet spike report records the tooling decision. | Keep docs changes minimal and evidence-led. |
| Handoff continuity | Active | Local ignored handoff `.handoffs/20260703173813_next_four_tasks_after_issue_sync.md` captures the pushed issue-sync summary, conversation-only requirements, and the next four evidence-gated tasks. | Use it as the first continuation surface if context resets in this workspace; do not commit handoff files. |

## Next Queue

1. Continue package feedback watch without opening `0.4.x` work.
   - Why now: `bin/check_published_gem 0.4.0` passed immediately after publish,
     the first post-push recheck passed, and this feedback sweep found no
     release/package defect.
   - Definition of done: any reported package install issue is triaged against
     the release tag and package metadata.
   - Files likely touched: issue/bugfix docs or code only if a concrete defect
     appears.
   - Not in scope: speculative package changes without a failing install path.

2. Keep #25 dogfood CI enforcement deferred until its trigger appears.
   - Why now: #25 explicitly waits for collaboration expansion; current evidence
     still shows no need to add optional Rubydex setup and dogfood runtime to CI.
   - Definition of done: leave #25 open but inactive unless collaboration
     broadens or CI dogfood enforcement becomes necessary.
   - Files likely touched: none.
   - Not in scope: adding a dogfood CI gate just because the release shipped.

3. Keep analyzer issues #27/#28 and analyzer behavior parked unless new
   evidence appears.
   - Why now: `0.4.0` shipped existing candidate analyzers and release
     hardening; issue comments now define the DeepInheritanceTree and
     RepeatedBranching evidence bars without changing behavior.
   - Definition of done: future work resumes from concrete cross-project
     evidence rather than the fact that the release shipped.
   - Files likely touched: none.
   - Not in scope: analyzer behavior, thresholds, statuses, suppressions,
     default-output policy, or target intake.

4. Decide the next non-release work only after new evidence appears.
   - Why now: #26 is closed, #25 is trigger-gated, #27/#28 are evidence-gated,
     and package feedback is clean.
   - Definition of done: keep the queue empty of implementation work until a
     package defect, collaboration trigger, or cross-project analyzer evidence
     appears.
   - Files likely touched: none.
   - Not in scope: starting speculative detector, CI, or tooling changes to keep
     the queue busy.

## Latest Slice Checkpoint

Slice: 2026-07-03 pushed issue sync and wrote handoff.

Window: 17:35:05-17:42:44 -0700, 7m 39s elapsed.

1. Pushed and verified the issue-sync checkpoint.
   - `bin/check_ci_parity` passed before push: 465 runs, 2026 assertions,
     0 failures, 0 errors, 6 skips; RuboCop inspected 196 files with no
     offenses; calibration smoke and guard scripts passed.
   - `543dfe2 Record issue queue sync` was pushed to `origin/main`.
   - CI run `28689484542` passed for `543dfe2` in 1m 22s.
2. Created a handoff document with the completed summary and next tasks.
   - Wrote local ignored handoff `.handoffs/20260703173813_next_four_tasks_after_issue_sync.md`.
   - The handoff includes conversation-only requirements: update this tracker,
     commit, keep using agenticons, and track elapsed time.
3. Carried forward the next four tasks for a fresh agent.
   - Verify pushed baseline and release/package state.
   - Keep #25 dogfood CI enforcement deferred unless its trigger fires.
   - Treat #27 DeepInheritanceTree work as evidence collection only.
   - Treat #28 RepeatedBranching work as evidence collection only.
4. Kept behavior and issue state unchanged.
   - No production Ruby, analyzer behavior, CI workflow, Sorbet, package, or
     GitHub issue state changes were made in this slice.
   - Open issue queue remains #25, #27, and #28; #26 remains closed.

Agenticons used: `planner: handoff next-four tasks`.

## Parked / Not Next

- Do not promote candidate analyzers to default output.
- Do not change analyzer thresholds from the current evidence.
- Do not add app-specific suppressions.
- Do not add another calibration target by default.
- Do not expand `RepeatedQueryCriteria` query forms.
- Do not implement generic classifier behavior until a design-only proposal
  proves generic, non-app-specific facts can separate useful design pressure
  from public extension surfaces.
